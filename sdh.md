# Health inequality vs inequity

- ***Health inequality*** 
- If differences observed involve "value judgements", it's latter
- 

# Social gradient / dose-response relationship


- Increasing quantities of social resources (eduction, class, income) have increasing levels in health
- Threshold model

## Follow-up questions

- How would you address individual needs suppose we are tackling a group of patients being triaged as OUD at the ED?
- Education-Health plot ($x$-$y$): what about effects of time? e.g. we measure y after $n$ years and associate that with $x$


 
 # (Absolute vs Relative) Social Position

- ***Absolute income hypothesis*** posits that "my health does not depend on what others earn"
- smart phone vs low-income
- Psychosocial pathways should be considered: do low-income families feel socially excluded when other low-income families begin to earn more? what about rising income of celebrities?
- ***Gini coefficient*** to summarize income inequality
- ***Townsend ind*ex**: Recreation, work, education, clothing, housing, diet
- Methods: multilevel modeling

# Place vs Space 
- ***Place*** refers to membership in policial/ academic unit
- Move away from point source of pollution improves health regardless of whether the move crosses the boundaries of place divisions
- Where as moving out of a place division may lose access to social aid

 # Absolution vs relative health inequalities

 - A: 10 per 100,000 hosp
 - B: 20 per 100,000 hosp
 - Abs diff(A,B): 10 per 100,000 hosp
 - Ratio(A,B): 2.0

Change over time adds complexity, e.g. 1o yrs later
- A: 45 per 100,000 hosp
- B: 60 per 100,000 hosp
- Abs diff(A,B): 15 per 100,000 hosp
- Ratio(A,B): 0.33

Abs diff: No change
Ratio: Yes!

Ex 1: occupation -> income -> blood pressure as surrogate of health status
- ***mediator*** are variables that fall between causal pathway

Ex 2: job promotion -> (?) race -> blood pressure (white sense the benefits to changes; black don't because sense of control remains the same)
- ***effect modifiers** are variables that help explain observed relationship

Is it unfair that pop. A has lower rate than pop. B?
- If yes, then that's health inequity

Recap: All inequities are all inequalities, but not vice-versa


# Value judgement

... requires context, info on politics, norms (not necessarily universal)


# Self-selection

- "People sort themselves"

# Context vs composition 

- Composition of an area affected by influx of chronically ill residents
- Is an effect compositional or contextual?
- **Knowing differences exist across contexts does not tell us why differences exist** p. 8
- does living in high poverty areas increase risk of getting sick?


# Seggregation

# Measures

From "Implicit value judgements" by Harper et al.:
- Concentration inndex
- Index of disparity
- Mean log deviation
- Extended Concentration Index for individuals
- ...


Group people by...

- SES
- Education
- Gender right now, sex at birth
- Geography (space, place)
- Time
- Education
- Income/ occupation


- Simple measure (absolute); 2 groups only
- Complex measures (more than 2 groups)
