# Social gradient / dose-response relationship


- Increasing quantities of social resources (eduction, class, income) have increasing levels in health
- Threshold model

## Follow-up questions

- How would you address individual needs suppose we are tackling a group of patients being triaged as OUD at the ED?
- Education-Health plot ($x$-$y$): what about effects of time? e.g. we measure y after $n$ years and associate that with $x$


 
 # (Absolute vs Relative) Social Position

- ***Absolute income hypothesis*** posits that "my health does not depend on what others earn"
- smart phone vs low-income
- Psychosocial pathways should be considered: do low-income families feel socially excluded when other low-income families begin to earn more? what about rising income of celebrities?
- ***Gini coefficient*** to summarize income inequality
- ***Townsend ind*ex**: Recreation, work, education, clothing, housing, diet
- Methods: multilevel modeling

# Place vs Space 
- ***Place*** refers to membership in policial/ academic unit
- Move away from point source of pollution improves health regardless of whether the move crosses the boundaries of place divisions
- Where as moving out of a place division may lose access to social aid

 # Absolution vs relative health inequalities

 - A: 10 per 100,000 hosp
 - B: 20 per 100,000 hosp
 - Abs diff(A,B): 10 per 100,000 hosp
 - Ratio(A,B): 2.0

Change over time adds complexity, e.g. 1o yrs later
- A: 45 per 100,000 hosp
- B: 60 per 100,000 hosp
- Abs diff(A,B): 15 per 100,000 hosp
- Ratio(A,B): 0.33

Abs diff: No change
Ratio: Yes!

occupation -> income -> blood pressure as surrogate of health status
- ***mediator*** are variables that fall between causal pathway

job promotion -> (?) race -> blood pressure (white sense the benefits to changes; black don't because sense of control remains the same)
- ***effect modifiers** are variables that help explain observed relationship

# Self-selection
